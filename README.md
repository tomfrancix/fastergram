# Fastergram

I was asked in an interview how to build instagram. I thought I would try it properly. (and modestly haha - a small scale version))

A new Instagram-copycat social media application that I am working on with PHP. I was asked in an interview how to build Instagram so afterwards I gave it a shot. I thought I would try it properly. (and modestly haha - a small scale version)) The best social media project I have done so far was Streamnote - but too many features made it far too complex. I am still focusing on a mobile-app esque design primarily. I'm making a simple interface and trying my best to refactor as much code as I can.

# Very much like instagram.

I designed Fastergram to mimic Instagram. Simply to see what the end product might be like.

# The browse area is entertaining.

In the main feed, users can only see posts from people they follow, or hashtags they are subscribed to. In the search area, users can see an array of recent posts, and additionally they can search for a hashtag and view the most recent post under that tag.

# Every user has a public profile.

When you visit a users public profile, this is what you see. This is where you can follow, or unfollow other users. You can click on their images and scroll through their gallery. If you visit your own profile, you will see an edit profile button, not messaging options.

# You can like, comment, reply, tag, hashtag...

You can like any post, anywhere. You can view the post in a separate page. Posts can contain entire blog post - not just an image. When you have read the post, you can view the comments, and write anything you like. You can like other comments, reply to them in a nested list, and in your admin, you can delete and edit your comments.

# The admin area is in dark mode.

I decided to make all the admin features in dark mode - for distinction. Here you can view and edit your posts, follows, subscriptions and general profile information. I'm still working on the insights, notifications, and messenger options.
